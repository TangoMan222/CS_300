1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

  In this project I needed to create a program that searched a data structure for a course and can print a list of courses or a single course.

2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

  I approached the problem like any other I broke the problem into many parts and coded each part sequentially.

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

  I always have issues setting up the header file and the source1 file, i overcame this by refering the my textbook and lots of youtube.

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

  I think the best thing I could implement in the future is to start sooner.

5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I have used more white space in this program which greatly increase the readability of my code and the maintainablity of my program and future implementation of it.
